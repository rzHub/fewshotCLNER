CRICKET - LEICESTERSHIRE TAKE OVER AT TOP AFTER INNINGS VICTORY .	[('ORG', 2, 2)]
LONDON 1996-08-30	[('LOC', 0, 0)]
West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship .	[('ORG', 12, 12), ('ORG', 14, 14), ('PER', 3, 4), ('MISC', 0, 1)]
Their stay on top , though , may be short-lived as title rivals Essex , Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire .	[('ORG', 13, 13), ('ORG', 15, 15), ('ORG', 17, 17), ('ORG', 24, 24), ('ORG', 35, 35)]
After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road , Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83 .	[('ORG', 2, 2), ('ORG', 14, 14), ('PER', 31, 32), ('LOC', 11, 12), ('LOC', 29, 29)]
Trailing by 213 , Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174 .	[('ORG', 4, 4), ('PER', 14, 14)]
Essex , however , look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('ORG', 26, 26), ('PER', 12, 13), ('PER', 15, 16), ('LOC', 28, 28)]
Hussain , considered surplus to England 's one-day requirements , struck 158 , his first championship century of the season , as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82 .	[('ORG', 22, 22), ('PER', 0, 0), ('LOC', 5, 5)]
By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes , taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain .	[('ORG', 3, 3), ('PER', 13, 13)]
At the Oval , Surrey captain Chris Lewis , another man dumped by England , continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire .	[('ORG', 4, 4), ('ORG', 39, 39), ('PER', 6, 7), ('LOC', 2, 2), ('LOC', 13, 13)]
He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven , a lead of 234 .	[('ORG', 13, 13), ('PER', 7, 8), ('LOC', 5, 5)]
Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings , still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('ORG', 14, 14)]
Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams , 123 , and Tim O'Gorman , 109 , took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233 .	[('ORG', 20, 20), ('PER', 1, 2), ('PER', 8, 9), ('PER', 14, 15), ('MISC', 0, 0)]
After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather , Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214 .	[('ORG', 17, 17), ('ORG', 24, 24)]
They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55 .	[('PER', 9, 10), ('PER', 15, 16), ('MISC', 12, 12)]
By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three .	[('ORG', 2, 2)]

The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2 .	[('MISC', 5, 5)]

Consumer spending , incomes edge up in July .	[]

WASHINGTON 1996-08-30	[('LOC', 0, 0)]
Consumer spending barely edged up in July , the Commerce Department said Friday , as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months .	[('ORG', 9, 10)]
Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June .	[]
Incomes from wages , salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June .	[]
Department officials said July 's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January , when they were flat .	[]
Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks .	[]
The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June .	[]
""" In July , average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined , more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment , "" Commerce said ."	[('ORG', 25, 25)]
But more money went into savings accounts , as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July .	[]
That was the highest savings rate since October last year , when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved .	[]
The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected .	[]
At the same time , the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July , with widespread gains across most major categories .	[('LOC', 17, 17)]
Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion , significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists .	[('LOC', 21, 22)]
That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders .	[]
Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July , partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks .	[]
In addition , the Labour Department 's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth .	[('ORG', 4, 5)]
It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June .	[]
Gains in personal income , which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends , interest and businesses , are essential for funding consumer purchases , which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity .	[]
Spending on all types of durable goods , which includes cars , fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June .	[]
But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June , while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion .	[]
Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion .	[]

South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday .	[('ORG', 16, 17), ('LOC', 0, 1), ('LOC', 28, 29)]
They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand , salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests .	[('LOC', 10, 11)]
It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil .	[('ORG', 28, 29), ('LOC', 12, 13), ('MISC', 33, 34)]
Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side 's inspiration , scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('PER', 2, 5), ('PER', 22, 23)]
Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other , scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties .	[('PER', 1, 2)]
The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points .	[('ORG', 1, 2), ('PER', 12, 13), ('PER', 16, 17)]
But they generally endured an off-day , highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal .	[('PER', 11, 12)]
Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap .	[('ORG', 6, 6), ('PER', 2, 3), ('PER', 17, 18)]
Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead , but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous .	[('ORG', 25, 25), ('PER', 0, 0)]
Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and , although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert 's reverse pass , Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts .	[('PER', 5, 5), ('PER', 18, 19), ('PER', 24, 24), ('PER', 31, 32), ('PER', 34, 36), ('MISC', 29, 29)]
Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback .	[('ORG', 8, 9), ('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 3, 3), ('PER', 11, 12)]
Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try .	[('ORG', 18, 18), ('PER', 1, 1)]
A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter .	[('ORG', 11, 12), ('ORG', 32, 32), ('PER', 4, 6), ('PER', 20, 20), ('PER', 26, 26)]
When the All Blacks did break through , it was too late .	[('ORG', 2, 3)]
Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation .	[('PER', 1, 2), ('PER', 5, 5), ('PER', 15, 16)]
