"Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers , but Volkova said the authorities are currently "" tackling the technicalities of the issue "" ."	[('PER', 16, 16)]
Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus .	[('PER', 15, 15), ('LOC', 8, 9)]

China copper stocks owned by state reserve - trade .	[('LOC', 0, 0)]
Lynne O'Donnell	[('PER', 0, 1)]
HONG KONG 1996-08-23	[('LOC', 0, 1)]
Up to 100,000 tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses , confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate , probably belongs to China 's strategic state reserve , industry sources said on Friday .	[('LOC', 8, 8), ('LOC', 27, 27)]
Around 40,000 tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou , where some of the strategic stockpile was stored , they said .	[('LOC', 17, 17)]
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp ( CNIEC ) in June and July .	[('ORG', 25, 32), ('ORG', 34, 34), ('LOC', 22, 22)]
It was unclear whether or not the 40,000 tonnes had cleared customs -- which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve , administered directly by the central government 's State Planning Commission , owned the copper .	[('ORG', 31, 33)]
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .	[]
But one source , the head of a Hong Kong trading house , said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not .	[('LOC', 8, 9)]
""" If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou , it will be sitting there for years , "" he said ."	[('LOC', 11, 11)]
""" Once it arrives in Yingkou , it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission , which has to give permission for any more movement ; it is out of the hands of traders , "" he said ."	[('ORG', 14, 16), ('LOC', 5, 5)]
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months , with traders unsure not only of who owns it , but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it .	[('LOC', 4, 4)]
Trading sources generally agreed it would be cost-effective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of long-term backwardation on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) .	[('ORG', 33, 35), ('ORG', 37, 37)]

Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam faltered in their second league match of the season on Saturday losing 2-0 away at Heerenveen .	[('ORG', 2, 3), ('ORG', 19, 19), ('MISC', 0, 0)]
Ajax , who had a dismal series of pre-season results before beating NAC of Breda in their opening game , had the best of an entertaining first half but failed to break the deadlock .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('ORG', 12, 12), ('LOC', 14, 14)]
Eight minutes after the interval , Heerenveen 's Romeo Wouden broke through the Amsterdam defence , left defender John Veldman standing and curled the ball beyond goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar into the Ajax net .	[('ORG', 6, 6), ('ORG', 33, 33), ('PER', 8, 9), ('PER', 18, 19), ('PER', 27, 30), ('LOC', 13, 13)]
Ajax , without injured defenders Marcio Santos and Winston Bogarde and strikers Jari Litmanen and Marc Overmars , then stepped up the pace and looked certain to equalise .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('PER', 5, 6), ('PER', 8, 9), ('PER', 12, 13), ('PER', 15, 16)]
But they left gaps at the back and on 73 minutes Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson rushed out of his own half , beat the Ajax defence and lobbed van der Sar .	[('ORG', 25, 25), ('PER', 13, 15), ('PER', 29, 31), ('MISC', 11, 11)]
The defeat means Ajax 's main title contenders PSV Eindhoven , who beat the champions 3-0 in the traditional league curtain-raiser , can go three points clear of their rivals if they beat Groningen on Sunday .	[('ORG', 3, 3), ('ORG', 8, 9), ('ORG', 33, 33)]

MOTORCYCLING - JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES .	[('PER', 6, 6), ('MISC', 2, 2)]
SUGO , Japan 1996-08-25	[('LOC', 0, 0), ('LOC', 2, 2)]
Teenager Yuuichi Takeda , racing in only his first season , outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday .	[('PER', 1, 2)]
Takeda , 18 , showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser , last year 's championship runner-up , with four of the 25 laps left .	[('ORG', 13, 13), ('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 15, 16), ('MISC', 12, 12)]
Honda 's Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('ORG', 9, 9), ('PER', 2, 2), ('PER', 6, 6), ('PER', 12, 13), ('PER', 15, 16), ('PER', 18, 18)]
But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third .	[('PER', 1, 1), ('PER', 15, 15), ('PER', 18, 18)]
Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at 147.159 kph .	[('PER', 0, 0)]
Corser , who crashed during practice on Friday , limped in fourth , four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand 11 seconds behind the winner .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 16, 16), ('PER', 20, 21), ('LOC', 23, 24)]
In the second race , Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki .	[('PER', 5, 5), ('PER', 26, 27)]
Aoki , the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika , had a race-long duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag .	[('ORG', 25, 25), ('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 10, 10), ('PER', 17, 18), ('LOC', 21, 22)]
Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki , who recorded the fastest lap of 147.786 kph , and then by Takeda .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 12, 12), ('PER', 26, 26)]
With Takeda out of the race , Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki .	[('PER', 1, 1), ('PER', 7, 7), ('PER', 16, 16)]
Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 10, 10), ('PER', 12, 12)]
But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on 280 points , followed by Corser with 269 and Kocinski with 254 .	[('PER', 15, 15), ('PER', 24, 24), ('PER', 28, 28), ('MISC', 6, 6)]

CRICKET - POLLOCK CONCLUDES WARWICKSHIRE CAREER WITH FLOURISH .	[('ORG', 4, 4), ('PER', 2, 2)]
LONDON 1996-08-25	[('LOC', 0, 0)]
South African fast bowler Shaun Pollock concluded his Warwickshire career with a flourish on Sunday by taking the final three wickets during the county 's Sunday league victory over Worcestershire .	[('ORG', 8, 8), ('ORG', 29, 29), ('PER', 4, 5), ('MISC', 0, 1)]
Pollock , who returns home on Tuesday for an ankle operation , took the last three wickets in nine balls as Worcestershire were dismissed for 154 .	[('ORG', 21, 21), ('PER', 0, 0)]
After an hour 's interruption for rain , Warwickshire then reached an adjusted target of 109 with 13 balls to spare and record their fifth win in the last six games .	[('ORG', 8, 8)]
Warwickshire are currently in fourth position behind Yorkshire , Nottinghamshire and Surrey .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('ORG', 7, 7), ('ORG', 9, 9), ('ORG', 11, 11)]
Yorkshire captain David Byas completed his third Sunday league century as his side swept clear at the top of the table , reaching a career best 111 not out against Lancashire .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('ORG', 30, 30), ('PER', 2, 3)]
Lancashire 's total of 205 for eight from 40 overs looked reasonable before Byas put their attack to the sword , collecting his runs from just 100 balls with three sixes and nine fours .	[('ORG', 0, 0), ('PER', 13, 13)]

Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England one-day squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval .	[('PER', 0, 1), ('LOC', 12, 12), ('LOC', 21, 21), ('LOC', 30, 31)]
A super piece of fielding by Lewis , dropped as a disciplinary measure after arriving only 35 minutes before the start on the fourth morning , provided the only bright spot for England as the touring team batted on to reach 413 for five at the interval , a lead of 87 .	[('PER', 6, 6), ('LOC', 32, 32)]
The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba , run out for 13 attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove .	[('PER', 6, 7), ('PER', 21, 21)]
There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails .	[('ORG', 6, 6), ('PER', 21, 22)]
Lewis , though , could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 13, 14), ('PER', 16, 17)]
Wasim rattled along to 30 not out , outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on 24 at the break , although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role .	[('PER', 0, 0)]

CAPE TOWN 1996-08-25	[('LOC', 0, 1)]
South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands .	[('LOC', 0, 1)]
Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid .	[('ORG', 20, 23), ('PER', 17, 18)]
Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers .	[('ORG', 9, 11), ('PER', 5, 7), ('PER', 14, 15)]
But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating .	[('PER', 19, 19)]
Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee .	[('PER', 3, 4)]
""" I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got , "" he said . """	[]
"That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all . """	[]
The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds .	[]
But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify .	[('PER', 10, 11)]
Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 5, 6)]
He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called .	[('PER', 7, 8)]
But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims .	[('PER', 1, 1)]
""" A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee ."	[]
"At the moment this is not the case . """	[]
He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks .	[('PER', 2, 2)]
His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that .	[]
Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission .	[('PER', 0, 0)]
Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied .	[('ORG', 9, 9), ('ORG', 14, 15), ('ORG', 19, 20), ('PER', 11, 12), ('PER', 23, 24), ('MISC', 27, 28)]
Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared :	[('PER', 0, 0)]
""" This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all ."	[]
"What the people expect is to have houses , to have jobs . """	[]
Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission .	[('ORG', 9, 10), ('PER', 2, 3)]
""" Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation ."	[]
"One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary , "" he said ."	[]

What it comes down to is this : If you 're highly skilled , you 'll benefit nicely .	[]
But if you 're not and cannot contribute to your employer 's goals , you 'll be paid less .	[]

Presently , for example , if an accountant 's job involves doing five specific tasks , he or she can expect a certain salary , said Sandra O'Neal , a Towers Perrin principal .	[('ORG', 30, 31), ('PER', 26, 27)]
"In the future , the accountant will be evaluated solely on "" knowledge , skill and abilities , "" she said ."	[]

While Mironivka 's scientists , some unpaid for months , carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine 's extreme continental climate , Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine 's agricultural sector is as bad as the drought .	[('ORG', 1, 1), ('PER', 25, 25), ('LOC', 19, 19), ('LOC', 32, 32)]
Collective farms and Ukraine 's nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser , no money for herbicides and pesticides , no money to repair old or buy new machinery , no money for fuel , and none to buy good seed .	[('LOC', 3, 3)]
This year 's harvest is down from last year 's 36.5 million tonne harvest , which in turn compares with 50 million tonnes in 1990 , the year before independence .	[]

Citing the disposal of Gencor 's stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals , Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets .	[('ORG', 4, 4), ('ORG', 11, 12), ('ORG', 24, 24), ('PER', 22, 22)]

He added that the group still had about 85 million rand after tax invested in various shares , which were market for disposal when required .	[]
Referring to Gencor 's increased 41.5 percent stake in Ingwe , Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more .	[('ORG', 2, 2), ('ORG', 9, 9), ('PER', 11, 11)]

Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the U.S. Open in protest over the men 's seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a four-set win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas .	[('PER', 0, 1), ('PER', 36, 37), ('MISC', 7, 8), ('MISC', 20, 20)]
""" I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , ' "" said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week ."	[('PER', 28, 28)]
""" But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay . """	[]
In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players .	[('ORG', 15, 15), ('LOC', 30, 30), ('MISC', 7, 7)]
One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia .	[('ORG', 25, 25), ('PER', 14, 15), ('LOC', 37, 37), ('MISC', 9, 9), ('MISC', 11, 12)]
Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury .	[('PER', 0, 0)]
At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings .	[('PER', 16, 17), ('LOC', 12, 12), ('MISC', 13, 14)]
""" The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport , "" Martin said ."	[('PER', 43, 43), ('MISC', 4, 5), ('MISC', 24, 25)]

""" I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA ."	[('ORG', 12, 12)]
"They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have , "" said Stich . """	[('PER', 17, 17)]
"I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow . """	[]
But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam .	[('PER', 4, 4), ('MISC', 22, 23)]
He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court .	[('PER', 15, 15), ('MISC', 19, 19)]
Others advancing early on Monday included 11th-seeded American Malivai Washington , the Wimbledon runner-up , Sweden 's Magnus Gustafsson , and two-time former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain , who will be Stich 's next opponent .

The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players .	[('PER', 7, 7), ('MISC', 11, 12)]
""" I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players , "" said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi ."	[('PER', 25, 25), ('PER', 34, 35), ('MISC', 12, 12), ('MISC', 31, 31)]
It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday .	[('PER', 2, 2)]
The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six .	[('ORG', 11, 11), ('MISC', 2, 2)]
""" He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now , "" said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon ."	[('PER', 3, 3), ('PER', 19, 19), ('PER', 26, 26), ('MISC', 34, 35), ('MISC', 37, 37)]
Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 23, 23)]
Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally .	[('PER', 6, 6), ('PER', 18, 19), ('LOC', 16, 16), ('MISC', 31, 31)]
But Stich did n't want to play that game .	[('PER', 1, 1)]
""" I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded , "" Stich said ."	[('PER', 23, 23)]

Chang committed an untidy 53 unforced errors , though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian , who also walloped a woeful 24 double faults .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('MISC', 15, 15)]
The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set , leading 6-4 in the tiebreaker .	[('PER', 7, 7)]
The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous , which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net .	[('PER', 18, 18)]

SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices .	[('ORG', 0, 0)]
WASHINGTON 1996-08-28	[('LOC', 0, 0)]
The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders .	[('ORG', 1, 4)]
The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote .	[]
The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them .	[('MISC', 13, 13)]
The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time .	[]
Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock .	[]
In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices .	[]
""" These rules are intended to empower all investors , by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field , and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions , "" said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt ."	[('ORG', 36, 36), ('PER', 38, 39)]
"The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create "" one system where one price could be available to everybody . """	[('ORG', 1, 1)]

In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests .	[('ORG', 8, 8)]
It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market .	[]
"It also cited the potential problem of a two-tiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems , thus robbing investors without access to "" hidden "" quotes the benefit of the best available prices ."	[]
Earlier this month , the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market , the National Association of Securities Dealers , agreed to spend $ 100 million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers ' trading practices .	[('ORG', 5, 5), ('ORG', 22, 26), ('MISC', 12, 12), ('MISC', 18, 18)]
The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed .	[('ORG', 1, 1)]
"The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the "" price improvement "" proposal again ."	[]
"The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous "" bid "" and "" ask "" quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than 1 percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq ."	[('MISC', 37, 37)]

NEW YORK 1996-08-27	[('LOC', 0, 1)]
It was n't supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the U.S. Open on Tuesday night .	[('PER', 11, 12), ('MISC', 20, 21)]
But the script that called for the usual first-round demolition by the top-ranked top seed was rewritten by 29th-ranked Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon .	[('PER', 20, 21), ('MISC', 19, 19)]
Graf , of course , prevailed 6-3 7-6 , but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('MISC', 19, 19)]
""" I won the second set , which I did n't think I would do , being down 5-2 and the chances she had at 6-5 , "" Graf recalled ."	[('PER', 28, 28)]
Several of the other women 's seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graf-like efficiency Tuesday .	[('MISC', 15, 15)]
As afternoon turned to evening , fourth-seeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in 58 minutes with the loss of just two games , one more than second seed Monica Seles , who opened the second-day programme by crushing American Anne Miller 6-0 6-1 .

Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario , the 1994 champion , and eighth-seeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round .	[('PER', 2, 4), ('PER', 15, 16), ('MISC', 12, 12)]
But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women 's side .	[]
Fifth-seed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan , the 10th seed , fell 6-2 7-5 to 53rd-ranked American Kimberly Po .	[('PER', 1, 2), ('PER', 10, 11), ('PER', 15, 16), ('PER', 30, 31), ('LOC', 4, 4), ('LOC', 18, 18), ('MISC', 9, 9), ('MISC', 13, 13), ('MISC', 29, 29)]
Date 's defeat left no other seeded players in Seles 's quarter of the draw , which lost Anke Huber ( 6 ) and Maggie Maleeva ( 12 ) on Monday .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 9, 9), ('PER', 18, 19), ('PER', 24, 25)]
But Graf , winner of 20 Grand Slam titles , was not about to join that list .	[('PER', 1, 1), ('MISC', 6, 7)]
""" At some points I felt a little nervous , "" she admitted . """	[]
"When it came down to the important points , I felt more confident . """	[]
Basuki , a first-round loser here for the fifth consecutive year , was clearly going for winners , hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking 5-2 lead .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 23, 23)]
Graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order .	[('PER', 0, 0)]
But Basuki , her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots , held her serve and twice had set point on Graf 's serve at 6-5 before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tie-break .	[('PER', 1, 1), ('PER', 23, 23), ('MISC', 30, 30)]
""" I lost the moment , "" lamented Basuki , who has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in Montreal earlier this month ."	[('PER', 8, 8), ('LOC', 17, 17), ('LOC', 25, 25)]
Still , the feisty Indonesian got off to a 3-0 lead in the tie-breaker before a pair of costly double faults gave Graf her chance to avoid a third set .	[('PER', 22, 22), ('MISC', 4, 4)]
""" Usually in the first one or two matches , you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it , "" said Graf , who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker ."	[('PER', 25, 25)]
""" To be in that situation today , a couple of times having to play well , get down and play point-by-point , definitely is a good start . """	[]

U.S. investors in troubled Lloyd 's of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a U.S. court decision in favour of Lloyd 's and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions .	[('ORG', 4, 7), ('ORG', 23, 24), ('LOC', 0, 0), ('LOC', 17, 17)]
A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse .	[('ORG', 7, 8), ('LOC', 1, 1)]

The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with 3.2 billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities .	[('ORG', 11, 11)]
The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by 1100 GMT Wednesday , but Lloyd 's chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended .	[('ORG', 20, 21), ('PER', 23, 24), ('MISC', 1, 1), ('MISC', 16, 16)]

The leader of a junior partner in Japan 's three-party ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion , party officials said on Wednesday .	[('LOC', 7, 7)]

They said the date of Takemura 's resignation would be determined by party officials .	[('PER', 5, 5)]

But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election .	[('ORG', 16, 16)]

EU Commission cool on changing beef cull plan .	[('ORG', 0, 1)]
BRUSSELS 1996-08-29	[('LOC', 0, 0)]
The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain 's mad cow epidemic would die out by 2001 but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign .	[('ORG', 1, 2), ('LOC', 12, 12)]

""" We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible ."	[('MISC', 19, 19)]

The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers , who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than 2001 without killing vast numbers of cattle .	[('ORG', 14, 14), ('ORG', 20, 20), ('MISC', 6, 6)]

Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some 147,000 cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('LOC', 7, 7), ('MISC', 27, 27)]

The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU , which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease .	[('ORG', 12, 12), ('LOC', 9, 9), ('MISC', 20, 20), ('MISC', 32, 32)]

MANCHESTER , England 1996-08-29	[('LOC', 0, 0), ('LOC', 2, 2)]
Tight bowling from Glamorgan off-spinner Robert Croft helped England to restrict Pakistan to 225 for five in their 50 overs in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Thursday .	[('ORG', 3, 3), ('PER', 5, 6), ('LOC', 8, 8), ('LOC', 11, 11), ('LOC', 26, 27)]
Croft , who was one of the few Englishmen to make a good impression in his test debut at The Oval last week , showed great control as he first dried up the early flow of Pakistan runs and then collected the wickets of Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram in a spell of 10-1-36-2 .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 44, 45), ('PER', 47, 48), ('LOC', 19, 20), ('LOC', 36, 36), ('MISC', 8, 8)]

After Wasim had won the toss and chosen to bat first , Pakistani made an excellent start as Sohail and Saeed Anwar continued their good form with an opening partnership of 82 .	[('PER', 1, 1), ('PER', 18, 18), ('PER', 20, 21), ('MISC', 12, 12)]
Anwar , who struck a superb 176 at The Oval , was the more aggressive as he made 57 from 75 balls before skying a catch off Irani to Mullally at long-on .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 27, 27), ('PER', 29, 29), ('LOC', 8, 9)]
Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed then added 59 for the second wicket before England struck back with three wickets for 19 in the space of five overs .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 2, 3), ('LOC', 12, 12)]
First , Sohail , after making 48 , was bowled by Croft as he stepped back to try and hit through the off-side .	[('PER', 2, 2), ('PER', 11, 11)]
Wasim , who promoted himself to number four in the order , followed for six when Croft drifted another well-flighted delivery behind his legs .	[('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 16, 16)]

Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body 's muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat .	[]
Death strikes in early adulthood .	[]
Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin .	[]
In the study at the University 's Institute for Human Gene Therapy , researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene .	[('ORG', 7, 11)]
The virus , which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system , was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes .	[]
In the experiment , between 30 to 40 percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing .	[]
Similar results had been obtained previously in test-tube cell cultures , but not in live animals , the university said .	[]
The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans , to further decrease the immune-system response to the virus , and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue .	[]

Wall Street ponders Rubin 's role if Clinton wins .	[('PER', 3, 3), ('PER', 7, 7), ('LOC', 0, 1)]
Donna Sells	[('PER', 0, 1)]
NEW YORK	[('LOC', 0, 1)]
The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected .	[('ORG', 29, 29), ('PER', 21, 22), ('PER', 33, 33), ('LOC', 12, 13)]
Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar .	[('PER', 7, 7)]
Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week .	[('ORG', 17, 17), ('PER', 2, 2), ('LOC', 27, 27), ('MISC', 24, 24)]
Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him .	[('PER', 1, 1), ('LOC', 4, 5)]
Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan .	[('ORG', 5, 5), ('PER', 0, 0), ('PER', 7, 8), ('LOC', 38, 38)]
""" Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies , "" said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc. "" Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar . """	[('ORG', 26, 28), ('PER', 5, 5), ('PER', 19, 20), ('PER', 31, 31), ('LOC', 34, 34)]
That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 .	[('MISC', 20, 22), ('MISC', 26, 26), ('MISC', 36, 36)]
Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen .	[]
Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar 's comeback , using skills and expertise gained in 26 years on Wall Street , part of which were spent as co-chairman of Goldman , Sachs and Co .	[('ORG', 33, 38), ('PER', 0, 0), ('LOC', 22, 23)]

""" Rubin has done a fine job in that position , "" said Michael Faust , a portfolio manager at Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds ."	[('ORG', 20, 24), ('PER', 1, 1), ('PER', 13, 14)]
""" Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill . """	[]
Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets .	[('ORG', 4, 4), ('MISC', 11, 11)]
Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening .	[('LOC', 8, 8)]
As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury .	[('ORG', 2, 3), ('ORG', 17, 18), ('ORG', 35, 35), ('PER', 6, 6), ('PER', 9, 10), ('PER', 31, 31)]
""" Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States , "" said Widness , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds ."	[('PER', 31, 31), ('LOC', 26, 27), ('LOC', 37, 37)]
Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results .	[('PER', 10, 10)]
If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency .	[('ORG', 8, 8), ('PER', 17, 17), ('LOC', 23, 24)]
