Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday .	[('LOC', 0, 0), ('LOC', 15, 15), ('MISC', 6, 7)]
But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan .	[('LOC', 1, 1), ('LOC', 23, 23)]
China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net .	[('PER', 18, 19), ('LOC', 0, 0), ('MISC', 16, 16), ('MISC', 34, 34)]
Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area .	[('PER', 0, 1)]

Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders .	[('LOC', 10, 10), ('MISC', 3, 4)]
Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria .	[('LOC', 11, 11), ('LOC', 26, 26)]
Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net .	[('PER', 0, 1), ('PER', 14, 15), ('PER', 23, 24), ('MISC', 19, 19)]
It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes .	[('LOC', 7, 7)]
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal .	[('PER', 1, 2), ('PER', 27, 27)]
Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute .	[('PER', 0, 1), ('LOC', 4, 4)]
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence .	[('LOC', 0, 0), ('MISC', 6, 6), ('MISC', 18, 18)]
Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did .	[('PER', 0, 0)]

Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said .	[('ORG', 2, 2), ('MISC', 0, 0)]
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround .

It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres .	[]
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer .	[('PER', 0, 1), ('MISC', 20, 20)]

Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors .	[('PER', 0, 1), ('LOC', 3, 3)]

But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic .	[('LOC', 35, 36)]
Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity .

The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions .

Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes .

Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday .	[('LOC', 2, 2)]
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen .	[('ORG', 11, 13), ('ORG', 15, 15), ('PER', 19, 20), ('LOC', 24, 24)]
